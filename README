Version 0.01 (alpha)

Description:
============


Installation:
=============


Usage:
======
The intended usage of this software is to serve as a more sophisticated file interpreting utility for other projects.
For this reason, it's probably best to compile this software into a shared object file, a static library file or just a local object file.
The included make-file "Makefile" has provisions for the shared object and local object compilations.
The "tester" argument serves as an example for how one could compile their own project using this software once it has been made into an object file.

Known Issues:
=============
I don't know why but for some reason, for bitmap files, when the number of channels is set to 1, weird unexpected stuff happens.
Will debug soon but for now, it seems to be working for the most part for normal RGB images where the number of channels is 3.
